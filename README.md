# About pom.js
A declarative UI library to write JavaScript apps.

# Goals
- [x] Use util functions to make new components and render it on DOM
- [ ] Create minimal Todo app - WIP
- [x] Optimise re-renders
- [x] State Management
- [ ] Create Todoist clone using these utils

# Hurdles
- [] components using `Component` class lose their internal state on re-renders
- [] supporting returns of multiple root elements from `Component` is resulting in complicated code, TS types
